    <Name>Buildings - River Buildings Require River in Vicinity</Name>
    <Stability>Alpha</Stability>
    <Teaser>River buildings that require city to be built on a river can be built if there are river tiles in city vicinity.</Teaser>
    <Description>Allows buildings that normally require city to be built on the river to still be built as long as there are river tiles within the city borders.

I made this mod to facilitate city placement as well as to increase realism.  There is no reason a city needs to be built ON a river just to construct a water mill or a levee.  In real life these buildings are constructed on rivers that are not necessarily inside a city. In fact more often than not, such buildings exist outside of cities.
