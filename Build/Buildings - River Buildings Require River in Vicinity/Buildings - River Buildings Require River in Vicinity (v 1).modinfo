    <Name>Buildings - River Buildings Require River in Vicinity</Name>
    <Teaser>River buildings that require city to be built on a river can be built if there are river tiles in city vicinity.</Teaser>
    <Description>Allows buildings that normally require city to be built on the river or lake to still be built as long as there are river / lake tiles within the city borders.

[h1]Affected Buildings[/h1]

The following can be built with at least one river tile within the city borders:

- Watermill
- Hydro Plant

The following can be built with at least one river OR lake tile within the city borders:

- Floating Gardens (lake and river in city vicinity)
- Garden (lake and river in city vicinity)

[h1]Description[/h1]

I made this mod to facilitate city placement as well as to increase realism.  There is no reason a city needs to be built ON a river just to construct a water mill or a levee.  In real life these buildings are constructed on rivers that are not necessarily inside a city. In fact more often than not, such buildings exist outside of cities.

Further to this, AI's get a minor boost since they are horrible at city placement. Often they found cities close to but not on a river.

The following buildings are affected:

- Garden
- Floating Gardens (Aztec)
- Water Mill
- Hydro Plant
